#In this project I created a web form that collects data from BAIS students at the University of Iowa. The main part of this is homework is to keep learning html and css. 

#Here the form is in multiple pages, and not just all on one. When the user input is valid, and all required fields have been answered, they are able to move to the next page. When not all required fields have been filled out, they are not able to move forward with the questions. At the start, you know that it is going to be a Business Analytics Student Survey, which is important with web forms. At the end of the web form, I also have a thank you.

#When looking at user accessability, the fonts on my web form are not too big and not to small which makes it user-friendly. Only one color is used which makes it look more professional. Tooltips are also used, so when there is a question about the process you can see what needs to be done.
